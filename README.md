```
As a MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT, 
I WANT an app that tests my geography knowledge 
SO THAT I can get better at identifying countries on a map.
WHEN I select a continent from the table
THEN I am presented with the name of the continent, a map of the continent, and a question is asking for a specific country‚Äôs location
WHEN I complete the quiz
THEN I am presented with the Results Page which shows which questions I got correct/incorrect and facts for each country
```
